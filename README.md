### How to rerun
Run this command<br>
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```<br>
It should run locally in port 5000. In addition at the top of the page there is a list where you can see the deployed version.

### Requirements
1. Provide a Mad Libs story for users to fill in.
2. Collect user input for the words
3. Print the story with all blanks filled in by the user's words 
4. Use at least 3 parts of speech for word replacement
5. Use variable assignment to store/use values
6. Write and call functions
7. Use at least one of the following core data types: strings, integers, floats.
8. Use at least one of the following collection types: lists, tuples, dictionary

### Stretch Goals

* Handlers Improper user input
* Story uses formatting and colors to provide a richer experience
* The story uses 4+ parts of speech
* Randomize the words of the same type (ie. shuffle the 5 nouns in terms of which noun blanks they go into).
* USe a dictionary to generate the words.
* use a different data structure to store words
* Build with test driven development (TDD)
* Use the system module (for accessing command-line arguments)
* add ASCII art/design to your story
* Take Mad Libs out of the terminal and have it running as a website.

### User Stories

* as a user I want to be able to read a small dialog intially telling me instructions.
* as a user I want to be able to see what kind I need to type
* As a user I want to be able to put in words and move through the process fluently.
* As a user I want to be able see my completed story. Maybe even see other completed stories.

### How it works
* It goes to a list of lists
* It asks for a pronoun first
* It asks for a noun
* It asks for a adjective
* It asks for a verb
